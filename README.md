# Posit-based DNN for autonomous driving
Repository of the project for the course of Symbolic and Evolutionary Artificial Intelligence, AIDE unipi.
In this project, we compared the performance (accuracy and inference time) of neural networks based on posit 
with those in other numerical formats. The tests were conducted with a classification task on the GTSDB 
dataset and an object detection task using the GTSRB dataset.
